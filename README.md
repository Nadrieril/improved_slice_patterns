# [`improved_slice_patterns`](https://docs.rs/improved_slice_patterns/)

A tiny crate that provides two macros to help matching
on `Vec`s and iterators using the syntax of [`slice_patterns`][slice_patterns]

[slice_patterns]: https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/unstable-book/language-features/slice-patterns.html

## Changelog

### V2.0

- `match_vec` now returns a `Result` instead of an `Option`. The `Err` variant
is used to return ownership of the passed vec if there was no match.
